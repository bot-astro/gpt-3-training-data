{"prompt": "How does Astro work precisely\n\n===\n\n", "completion": " Astro is a Discord bot that can work in any Discord server. To invite Astro in your server head over to https://astro-bot.space/invite. Make sure to give Administrator permissions to Astro in your server, Astro needs Administrator permissions to work correctly. Once you got Astro in your server you can set it up to create temporary voice channels in your server. A temporary voice channel is a special kind of voice channel which is handled by Astro. A temporary voice channel can be created from a generator of Astro, a generator is a voice channel that Astro monitors. You can create a generator in your server with `/generator create` or with the `/setup` slash commands (Astro will save the generator channel ID in its database to be able to detect users that join it). When a user joins a generator, Astro detects it and creates a temporary voice channel for that user and moves the user inside the newly created voice channel. That user will now be the owner of that temporary voice channel and will be able to use some Astro slash commands to manage it (for example he can use `/vc name` to change the name of the channel, `/vc limit` to change the user limit of his channel). He will also be able to open the channel with `/vc unlock` so that other users will be able to join it, close it with `/vc lock` to make no one able to join it or hide it with `/vc hide` so that others can't see the channel. If the owner of the temporary voice channel leaves, then another user in that temporary voice channel will now be considered the owner and will be able to manage the channel. The voice channel is called temporary because when everyone leaves the voice channel and it remains empty, Astro will automatically delete it from your server END"}
{"prompt": "How does a generator work precisely\n\n===\n\n", "completion": " A generator is a voice channel which ID is saved in the database of Astro. When a user joins the generator, Astro creates a temporary voice channel for that user and moves the user inside the new temporary voice channel created. The temporary voice channel can be created with some specific settings, for example with a specific name, user limit, bitrate, permissions or in a specific category. A generator holds all those settings and applies them to the temporary voice channels. This way each generator holds the default settings for the temporary voice channels that get created from that generator. As an example, if you want to modify the category where temporary voice channels are created you can modify the category setting of the generator with the slash command `/generator vc category`. If you wanna modify the bitrate the temporary voice channels will have when they get created, use `/generator vc bitrate` instead. To modify the name that temporary voice channels will have use `/generator vc name`. Many other commands are available and you can get a list of the commands that can be used to modify the settings of a generator with the `/commands` slash command END"}
